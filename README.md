# Hangman game


---

## 📌 Abstract

The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where the player attempts to identify a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. This project presents a **Python-based terminal version** of Hangman, designed for educational and recreational purposes. The game introduces players to fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, string operations, data structures, and user interaction in a command-line interface.

## 🧪 Methodology

The development of the game followed a structured, modular approach:

1. **Problem Decomposition**:
   - The game was broken down into logical components: word selection, input validation, game state tracking, and user feedback.

2. **Data Structures**:
   - Sets and lists were used to efficiently track guessed letters and the target word structure.
   - Dictionaries or predefined lists were used for word selection.

3. **Game Logic Design**:
   - The game loop handles user input, checks for win/loss conditions, and updates the game state accordingly.
   - Input validation ensures only valid guesses are accepted.
   - Incorrect guesses decrement a counter and are tracked for display.

4. **User Experience**:
   - Clear prompts, feedback messages, and formatting were used to guide the player.
   - Emojis and structured messages improve engagement in the terminal environment.

├── hangman.py         # Main game file containing all logic
├── README.md          # This documentation
└── wordlist.txt       # Optional: Load words externally (future scope)
Core Functions
Word Selection:

python
Copy
Edit
word = random.choice(word_list).lower()
Game Display Function:

python
Copy
Edit
def get_display_word():
    return " ".join([letter if letter in guessed_letters else "_" for letter in word])
Game Loop:

python
Copy
Edit
while attempts_left > 0 and '_' in display_word:
    # input, validation, game logic, win/loss checks
Win/Loss Conditions:

Win: All letters revealed before attempts run out

Loss: Attempts drop to zero before guessing the full word

Sample Run (Terminal)

👋 Welcome to the Hangman Game!
📝 I’ve picked a word. You need to guess it, one letter at a time.
❗ You have 6 incorrect attempts before you lose the game.

Word: _ _ _ _ _
Guessed letters: None
🔤 Type a letter: e
✅ Good guess!

Word: _ e _ _ _
🏁 Conclusion
This Hangman game demonstrates how a simple text-based application can effectively teach and reinforce core Python concepts such as:

Control flow (loops, if-else)

Data structures (lists, sets)

Function-based code organization

Basic user input/output handling

It is beginner-friendly, easy to extend, and serves as a solid base for more advanced versions (GUI, web, AI opponent, or multiplayer modes). Whether you're a learner or a hobbyist, this project offers a fun and educational experience.

🔮 Future Scope
✅ Load words from a text file or API

✅ Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)

✅ Build GUI using Tkinter or PyGame

✅ Add scoring and leaderboard system

✅ Develop a web version using Flask or Django
